## Golden State Warriors

## Average Scored Points per Game

```{r echo = FALSE}
# read scores
load('../data/clean/scores.RData')

# random samples of scores
set.seed(45678)
size <- 50
srs15 <- sample(scores15, size = size)
srs16 <- sample(scores16, size = size)

# two sample z-test
ztest <- two_sample_ztest(srs15, srs16)
```

- Simple Random Sample of `r size` games

### Season 2014-2015

- Avg score per game = `r round(mean(srs15), 3)`
- Std Dev sample = `r round(sd(srs15), 3)`

### Season 2015-2016

- Avg score per game = `r round(mean(srs16), 3)`
- Std Dev sample = `r round(sd(srs16), 3)`


## Hypothesis

### Null hypothesis

There's not a real difference between average scores

### Alternative hypothesis

Avg Score p/game 2016 > Avg Score p/game 2015


## Z-Statitic and P-value

$$
z = \frac{Obs Difference - Exp Difference}{SE}
$$

- Obs Difference = $Avg_{2015} - Avg_{2016}$
- Expected Difference = 0
- Std Error Difference = $\sqrt{SD_{2015}^2 + SD_{2016}^2}$


## Significance Test

- Z-statistic = `r round(ztest$statistic, 3)`
- P-value = `r round(ztest$pvalue, 3)`
